# Palindrome Checker

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to create an app that checks whether a given input is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

## What I Learned

This project challenged me to implement various JavaScript methods for string manipulation and user interaction. Here are some features of JavaScript I used:

- **String Manipulation**: I used the `replace()` method with a regular expression to remove all non-alphanumeric characters from the input string.
- **Array Methods**: The `split()` method was used to convert the processed input string into an array of characters, and the `reverse()` method was used to reverse the array. Finally, the `join()` method was used to convert the reversed array back into a string.
- **Conditional Statements**: I utilized an `if...else` statement to compare the processed input string with its reversed version to determine if it is a palindrome or not.
- **Event Handling**: I used the `addEventListener()` method to attach a click event listener to the check button, triggering the palindrome check function when clicked.
